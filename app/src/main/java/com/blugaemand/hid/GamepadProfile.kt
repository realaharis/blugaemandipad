/**
 * Everything that is specific to how one class of host expects a gamepad to present itself: the
 * SDP metadata it sees while pairing, the HID report descriptor it parses, and the wire format of
 * the input reports.
 *
 * This is the seam for supporting additional hosts. Windows, Linux and Android all accept the
 * standards-compliant [GenericHidProfile]; fussier hosts (the Nintendo Switch in particular)
 * expect a specific report layout and get their own implementation rather than special cases
 * threaded through the service.
 *
 * Deliberately free of Android imports so implementations can be unit-tested on the JVM.
